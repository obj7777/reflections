- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you work with other people or want your changes available for others.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to accept changes others have made just yet.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is copy of a repository made on GitHub. Clone is a copy of a repository. Branch is a copy made inside a repository. I would use a branch for 
making changes and a fork or clone for making changes to a repository I don't have permission to change.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You may not have access to the remote repository when you want to access its contents.

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

If not other version control software, I would have to collaborate by email. It would be harder keeping files and updates organized.
Learning curve would be easier since no one has to learn how to use git or github.

-When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you want to test a new feature that you may not want to add to the master. Using a separate branch allows you to save the changes for later, but you may have to merge it later.
