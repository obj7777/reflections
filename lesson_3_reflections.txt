- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you work with other people or want your changes available for others.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to accept changes others have made just yet.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is copy of a repository made on GitHub. Clone is a copy of a repository. Branch is a copy made inside a repository. I would use a branch for 
making changes and a fork or clone for making changes to a repository I don't have permission to change.
