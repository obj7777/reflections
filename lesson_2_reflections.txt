-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init creates a .git directory with meta data. You need to do it to start keep track of changes with commit.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a temporary area to see changes before committing them. Its value is it allows you to review files before making the commit.

-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add one file to the staging area to be committed at time. I can also see the files in the staging area to make sure I'm only committing the files I want.
